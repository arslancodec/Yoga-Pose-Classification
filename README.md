# Yoga-Pose-Classification
Yoga Pose Classification using TensorFlow involves training a convolutional neural network with data augmentation techniques to accurately identify different yoga poses from images. The model uses layers like Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, and Dropout, with ImageDataGenerator for training and validation data preprocessing.
